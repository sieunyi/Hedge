The goal of Hedge is to obtain optimal hedge ratios using two different methods: one is traditionally used minimum variance hedge ratio, and the other one is minimizing the semivariance hedge ratio. Based on obtained hedge ratio, the hedging effectiveness is obtained and compared.  

## Installation

You can install the released version of Hedge from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Hedge")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sieunyi/Hedge")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Hedge)



```

To properly utilize this package, you first need to import two sets of data: first column with spot price, second column with futures price that you want to calculate the hedge ratio with. Next, name this data set as x.  
```{r data}
data(fx)
spot_price = fx$...1
futures_price = fx$...2
x = cbind(spot_price, futures_price)
source('~/new folder/Hedge/R/hedge.R', echo=TRUE)
```

Finally, call the function within the package defining the window length you want to compare. 
```{r}
## basic example code
WinLen = 15
 out1 <- mvhr(x, WinLen)
 out2 <- svhr(x, WinLen) 
```




In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
