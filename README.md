The goal of Hedge is to obtain optimal hedge ratios using two different
methods: one is traditionally used minimum variance hedge ratio, and the
other one is minimizing the semivariance hedge ratio. Based on obtained
hedge ratio, the hedging effectiveness is obtained and compared.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Hedge from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Hedge")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sieunyi/Hedge")
#> Skipping install of 'Hedge' from a github remote, the SHA1 (0fbff0ca) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
# For installation with vignette
devtools::install_github("sieunyi/Hedge", build_vignettes = TRUE)
#> Skipping install of 'Hedge' from a github remote, the SHA1 (0fbff0ca) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

    ## Example
    
    
    
    ```r
    library(Hedge)

To properly utilize this package, you first need to import two sets of
data: first column with spot price, second column with futures price
that you want to calculate the hedge ratio with. Next, name this data
set as x.

``` r
data(fx)
spot_price = fx$...1
futures_price = fx$...2
x = cbind(spot_price, futures_price)
source('~/new folder/Hedge/R/hedge.R', echo=TRUE)
#> 
#> > mvhr <- function(x, WinLen) {
#> +     x <- stats::na.omit(x)
#> +     if (WinLen <= 0) {
#> +         stop("Window Length should be positive")
#> +     }
#> +     .... [TRUNCATED] 
#> 
#> > "fx"
#> [1] "fx"
#> 
#> > semivar <- function(v, w) {
#> +     meanV <- as.vector(crossprod(w, v))
#> +     SV <- crossprod(w, (pmax(meanV - v, 0))^2)
#> +     return(SV)
#> + }
#> 
#> > svhr <- function(x, WinLen) {
#> +     x <- stats::na.omit(x)
#> +     if (WinLen <= 0) {
#> +         stop("Window Length should be positive")
#> +     }
#> +     .... [TRUNCATED]
```

Finally, call the function within the package defining the window length
you want to compare.

``` r
## basic example code
WinLen = 15
 out1 <- mvhr(x, WinLen)
 out2 <- svhr(x, WinLen) 
```

``` r
# compare hedge ratio
plot(out2$HR_sv, type= 'l', col=1)
lines(out1$HE, type='l', col=4)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="100%" />

In that case, donâ€™t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
